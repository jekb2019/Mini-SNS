# Mini SNS

Mini SNS is a simple twitter-like forum where you can post, delete your thoughts and share it with everyone.

# Demo

Here is a short demo GIF for you!

# Responsiveness

Mini SNS is responsive enough to support both Desktop and Mobile! It is not a big deal but I just wanted to show you because the laptop and mobile wireframe kinda looked cool.

## Mobile

# How To Use

The user interface of Mini SNS focuses on intiotiveness so that no user manual is necessary for the new users. However, here are some basic user namual to be even more clearer!

## Forum

When you first visit Mini SNS, you will see the posts that is already uploaded by other people.

## Sign Up

Obviously, the first thing we need to do is sign up. Let's sign up and fully utilize the Mini SNS app! Click the "LOG IN" button in the upper right corner.

When the login modal appears, click "SIGN UP" link at the bottom of the modal to switch to signup modal.

Fill in all the details specified. Remember, your password cannot be less than 8 characters for the security reason! Also, your email should be valid as we will be sending a verification code for you to complete the signup process.

When you are done, click the "SIGN UP" button and check your inbox. Shortly, you will receive a verification code. Simply insert that into the prompt box.

## Log In

As you are now signed up, it's time to log in. Otherwise you won't be able to upload a new post!!

Following the similar process, let's click "LOG IN" button to open up the modal and log in!

If you are successfully logged in, you will see "Hi your name" on the top left of the app.

## Upload a post

In the input box, share your thought and simply hit enter or click "POST" button. (btw, if you submit an empty content, it will refuse to add a post for you!).

Do you see your post just have been appeared?

## Delete a post

If you change your mind, you can simply hit "DELETE" button to remove the post that you uploaded.

Keep in mind that you CANNOT delete other people's posts! (It will probably hurt their feeling if you do so :0)

## Scroll down

If the forum is overflowing and you don't want to scroll down infinitely, just click the scroller and let it do it for you.

## Um...

I wish I could show you the URL to access Mini SNS but since I am using AWS free tier, I was a bit scared because I might get charged tonnes of money if you overload the forum with thousands of posts.
