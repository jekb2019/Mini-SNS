## Sign Up

Obviously, the first thing we need to do is sign up. Let's sign up and fully utilize the Mini SNS app! Click the "LOG IN" button in the upper right corner.

When the login modal appears, click "SIGN UP" link at the bottom of the modal to switch to signup modal.

Fill in all the details specified. Remember, your password cannot be less than 8 characters for the security reason! Also, your email should be valid as we will be sending a verification code for you to complete the signup process.

When you are done, click the "SIGN UP" button and check your inbox. Shortly, you will receive a verification code. Simply insert that into the prompt box.

## Log In

As you are now signed up, it's time to log in. Otherwise you won't be able to upload a new post!!

Following the similar process, let's click "LOG IN" button to open up the modal and log in!

If you are successfully logged in, you will see "Hi your name" on the top left of the app.

In the input box, share your thought and simply hit enter or click "POST" button. (btw, if you submit an empty content, it will refuse to add a post for you!).

Do you see your post just have been appeared?

## Delete a post

If you change your mind, you can simply hit "DELETE" button to remove the post that you uploaded.

Keep in mind that you CANNOT delete other people's posts! (It will probably hurt their feeling if you do so :0)

## Um...

I wish I could show you the URL to access Mini SNS but since I am using AWS free tier, I was a bit scared because I might get charged tonnes of money if the forum get overloaded with thousands of posts (which will probably not happen anyway).
